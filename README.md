# React Three.js 3D Model Viewer

This project utilizes `@react-three/drei` and `@react-three/fiber` to create immersive 3D experiences within a Next.js application. By leveraging `@react-three/drei`, developers can easily render 3D models, apply realistic lighting, and integrate interactive controls without requiring extensive knowledge of Three.js.

## Features

- 🚀 **Seamless 3D Model Integration**: Effortlessly load `.glb` and `.gltf` files for realistic rendering.
- 🎥 **Interactive Camera Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and pan using `OrbitControls` for enhanced user experience.
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance**: Supports lightweight 3D formats with efficient WebGL rendering and scene management.
- 💡 **Lighting & Environment**: Enhance visual appeal with ambient and directional lighting, as well as HDRI-based environments.
- 🛠️ **TypeScript Support**: Ensures robust type safety and maintainability for scalable development.
- 🎞️ **Animation Handling**: Easily integrate animations stored within `.glb` or `.gltf` files using `useAnimations` from `@react-three/drei`.

## Requirements

- 📦 **Next.js & TypeScript**: For a component-based and type-safe development approach, ensuring maintainability and reusability.
- 🖥️ **Node.js 16.8+**: Required to run the project efficiently with the latest features.
- 📁 **GLB & GLTF Formats**: Recommended for optimal performance, smaller file sizes, and Physically Based Rendering (PBR) support.
- 🎨 **Three.js Knowledge (Optional)**: While not required, understanding the basics of Three.js can help with advanced customizations.

## Installation & Setup

To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

📂 Place your `.glb` or `.gltf` model inside the `public/` directory for easy access and loading, as Next.js serves static files from this directory, making it an ideal location for assets.

🔧 Convert your 3D model into a TypeScript component using [this tool](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/), which automatically converts `.gltf` or `.glb` files into optimized React components, simplifying integration into your project. Then, wrap the model inside a React `<Canvas>` component for proper rendering, lighting, and camera interactions.

## Usage

1. 🎨 **Create a Model Component**: Load the 3D model using the `useGLTF` hook.
2. 💡 **Configure Lighting**: Use `ambientLight`, `directionalLight`, and `Environment` for a realistic look.
3. 🎥 **Enable Camera Controls**: Add `OrbitControls` to allow rotation, zooming, and panning.
4. 🌐 **Import into Main Page**: Integrate the model viewer into your Next.js application for rendering.

## Best Practices

- 📌 **Prefer GLB or GLTF** for better rendering quality, smaller file sizes, and faster load times.
- 🔆 **Optimize Lighting** to create natural and realistic visual effects with minimal performance impact.
- 📏 **Adjust Model Scale** to ensure proper proportions in the scene and prevent rendering issues.
- 🎮 **Enable Camera Controls** for a more interactive and user-friendly experience. Customize `OrbitControls` to fine-tune camera movement, adjusting rotation speed, zoom limits, and damping for smoother interactions tailored to different applications.
- 🏗️ **Maintain a Clean Component Structure** for better code readability, modularity, and reusability.
- ⏳ **Preload Models** to prevent long loading times and improve user experience.
- 🚀 **Optimize Performance** by limiting unnecessary re-renders and using efficient asset management techniques.

For further customization and optimization, refer to the official [@react-three/drei documentation](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). Explore additional presets for lighting, environments, and camera configurations to enhance your 3D scenes. 🎨 Try using `Stage` for preconfigured studio lighting, `ContactShadows` for realistic ground shadows, and `Sky` for dynamic atmospheric effects.
